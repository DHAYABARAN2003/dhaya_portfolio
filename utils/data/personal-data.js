    "Hi, I’m an MCA graduate and Flutter developer passionate about creating real-time, scalable, and user-friendly applications. During my internship, I built a food delivery app, which gave me strong hands-on experience with Flutter (MVVM, Provider), REST APIs, Firebase, and cloud integration.I also have experience with Python, Java, and MySQL, along with skills in UI/UX optimization, database management, and problem-solving. I enjoy working in collaborative environments, using tools like Git/GitHub and Agile workflows, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies.",
